# Project Overview

This project involves the creation of an interactive map using the Folium library in Python. The map displays information about volcanoes in India, with markers indicating their locations and additional details such as name and elevation. Additionally, the map includes a layer showing population statistics using GeoJSON data.

## Files in the Project

1. **Main Python Script:**
   - **File:** `project.py`
   - **Description:** This is the main script that generates the interactive map. It uses the Folium library to create a map centered around India, with markers representing volcanoes. The color of each marker indicates the elevation of the corresponding volcano. The script also incorporates a GeoJSON layer displaying population statistics worldwide.

2. **Volcanoes Data File:**
   - **File:** `4.1 Volcanoes.txt`
   - **Description:** This CSV file contains data about various volcanoes in India, including their latitude, longitude, name, and elevation. The script reads this file to extract information for marker placement on the map.

3. **GeoJSON Data File:**
   - **File:** `world.json`
   - **Description:** This GeoJSON file contains global geographical data, including population statistics. The script utilizes this data to create a layer on the map that visualizes population density worldwide.

4. **Output HTML File:**
   - **File:** `Mys.html`
   - **Description:** The interactive map generated by the script is saved in this HTML file. Users can open this file in a web browser to explore the map with interactive features, including zooming, panning, and tooltips.

## Design Choices

1. **Marker Colors:**
   - **Decision:** The color of volcano markers is determined by their elevation.
   - **Explanation:** This choice makes it easier for users to quickly identify the relative elevations of different volcanoes on the map. Green markers represent low elevations, orange for medium elevations, and red for high elevations.

2. **Population Density Visualization:**
   - **Decision:** Population density is visualized using a GeoJSON layer with varying colors.
   - **Explanation:** This design choice provides users with an additional layer of information on the map. Different colors represent different population density levels, offering insights into global demographic patterns.

3. **HTML Output:**
   - **Decision:** The final map is saved as an HTML file (`Mys.html`).
   - **Explanation:** HTML output allows for easy sharing of the interactive map. Users can open the HTML file in any web browser without requiring additional software or dependencies.

## Running the Project

1. Ensure that Python and the required packages (Folium, Pandas) are installed.
2. Place the data files (`4.1 Volcanoes.txt` and `world.json`) in the same directory as the script.
3. Run the script (`project.py`) to generate the interactive map.
4. Open the generated `Mys.html` file in a web browser to explore the interactive map.

Feel free to explore and customize the script for your specific use case or region of interest! If you encounter any issues, please refer to the documentation or reach out for assistance.
